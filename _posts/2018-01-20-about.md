The Giving Box is a site dedicated to thoughtful and charitable posts, views and opinions of me, Jonathan MacCullagh, a realtor from Melbourne. I have always been passionate and eager about sharing my success with others and making a difference. And I think that through this website, I will be able to achieve just that.

I am interested in wide variety of areas and do intend to make posts relating to at least some of those areas. At the end of the day, I want to give you something useful and meaningful. I hope you enjoy my website.
